This is a very simple version of forex trading bot.
This readme file provides information on how to use and operate the forex pair trading bot. The bot is designed to automate forex trading activities, allowing users to maximize profits while minimizing the risks associated with manual trading.

This includes providing API keys for the exchanges you wish to trade on, setting trading parameters, and choosing a trading strategy. You can find detailed instructions on how to configure the bot in the documentation.

Usage
Once you have configured the bot, you can start using it to trade the forex pair. The bot will automatically monitor market conditions and execute trades based on your chosen trading strategy. You can monitor the bot's activity and performance using the built-in dashboard, which provides real-time data on your trades, profits, and losses.
